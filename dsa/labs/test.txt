In a pestilential prison with a life long lock

Awaiting the sensation of a short sharp shock
From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block

A dull dark dock a life long lock
A short sharp shock a big black block
To sit in solemn silence in a pestilential prison

From a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block
